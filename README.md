# python-stuff
I've never used python before today (12/27/23). I was asked to create an image sorter, so I did. Other stuff might be put here eventually.

## Image Sorter
Provides a basic yet comprehensive way to quickly sort images using a source folder, and up to nine destination folders. You can use the respective keys to quickly input your choice, and it's all contained within a very basic GUI.
### REQUIREMENTS
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [Send2Trash](https://pypi.org/project/Send2Trash/)
    - **Note:** You can run the "pip-install.cmd" in the Image Sorter folder to install Send2Trash & Pillow
